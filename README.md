Note: Please note that I previously completed this challenge in April 2023 and had to differentiate it from that repo by adding "Sept" to the end of the repo name.  This is all new work.

### PyBank  
This project was a financial analysis covering 86 months of profit/loss data. I was required to look through the data to find the following information and save it to a text file:   
-Total Months  
-Total Profit or Loss  
-Average monthly change  
-Greatest increase in profits  
-Greatest decrease in profits  

### PyPoll  
This project was an analysis of voting data that included each voter ID, their county, and the candidate they selected.  I was required to loop through the data to find the following information and save it to a text file:  
-Total votes cast  
-A list of the candidates, including percentage and number of votes received  
-The winning candidate  

The resulting voter data script is limited in its use because it can only count for three candidates.  Utilizing the pandas library in python would allow for a more robust script that could handle an unknown number of candidates.   

This repo contains the following files:   
1) README.md ~ this readme file   
-PyBank folder  
1) main.py - python script    
2) Resources folder - budget_data.csv - file containing profit and loss data for evaluation    
3) Analysis folder - financial_analysis.txt - results of the main.py script  
-PyPoll folder  
1) main.py - python script    
2) Resources folder - election_data.csv - file containing voter data for evaluation    
3) Analysis folder - voter_analysis.txt - results of the main.py script
