Note: Please note that I previously completed this challenge in April 2023 and had to differentiate it from that repo by adding "Sept" to the end of the repo name.  This is all new work.

###PyBank
This project required me to loop through 3-years of stock price data using VBA to find the following for each stock:  
-Yearly Change (green fill = positive; red fill = negative)  
-Percentage Change  
-Total Stock Volume  

Then I created a table for each year that listed the stocks with the following characteristics:  
-Largest Percentage Change  
-Smallest Percentage Change  
-Largest Total Stock Volume  

This repo contains the following files:  
1) alphabetical_testing.xlsm ~ A smaller file to practice running the macro  
2) Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm ~ Contains 3-years of stock price data for evaluation  
3) tickers_loop2.bas ~ VBA Macro to run on #2 above  
4) Screenshot_tab2018.jpg ~ screenshot of the year 2018 tab of #2 showing the macro results  
5) Screenshot_tab2019.jpg ~ screenshot of the year 2019 tab of #2 showing the macro results  
6) Screenshot_tab2020.jpg ~ screenshot of the year 2020 tab of #2 showing the macro results  
7) README.md ~ this readme file
